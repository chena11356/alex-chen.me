                ABMs are common in biology! For example, they can help model 
                ecological equilibria by introducing agents of certain species 
                of plants and animals into a simulated environment. The 
                interactions of these agents can then help isolate the factors 
                that may lead to the preservation or destruction of ecological 
                stability. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The following is a simple demo ABM for ecology. Predators, 
                denoted in red, must eat prey, denoted in blue, to survive. Prey must 
                eat plants, denoted in green. Notice how the populations of predators, 
                prey, and plants tend to approach an equilibrium, which can be modeled 
                by logistic growth functions. 
              </p>
              <p>
                From this demo, it may seem that ABMs are useful for educational 
                purposes, visualizing data in a digestible and visually appealing 
                manner. But their primary scientific benefit comes from highlighting 
                principles of emergence. Let's say we introduced more factors, 
                such as conservation efforts, invasive species, or more complicated 
                agent behavior algorithms. We could then explore how these factors 
                impact the system as a whole, and if we input real-life ecological 
                data, our ABM can help inform environmental policy decisions, or
